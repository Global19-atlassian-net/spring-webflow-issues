This is a simple template for creating issue reproduction projects per
the README.markdown file in the root of this repository (and at
https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-webflow-issues#readme).  
Please read that document completely before starting.

As described at the link above, copy this project to a new directory
having the same name as the JIRA issue you're trying to reproduce and
edit from there.

A Maven (pom.xml) build script is included for your convenience.
